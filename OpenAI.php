Depending on the requirements of our customers, some of whom prefer that all suppliers belong to a single scheme usually due to a desire to align all their suppliers using the same platform understandably to drive efficiencies through their business our internal compliance and supplier approval policy allows the submission of compliance reports from 3 respected compliance monitoring organisations. These broadly aligned programs cover a variety of aspects and categories, including civil liberties, remuneration, and environmental concerns. \n\nThese basic principles and rights all draw from or originate from the 1998 Declaration on workers' rights made by the International Labour Organization. The Declaration was originally adopted by the International Labour Conference, at its Eighty-sixth Session in Geneva on the 18th of June 1998. \n\nThe principles that guide our social compliance program are derived from the conventions and declaration of the International Labour Organisation. Adherence is measured through physical audits conducted on site by independent internationally respected bodies on our behalf. Social Accountability SA 8000, Amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative) and SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) to companies who support such responsible behaviour and wish to communicate this effectively to customers, partners and consumers.\n\nThe goal of above standards is to improve working conditions all over the world. They are therefore concerned with matters such as child and forced labour, occupational health and safety, freedom to establish employee representation organizations, discrimination, living wages and work conditions. \n\nBSCI SEDEX and SA 8000 support the efforts of companies to improve their Corporate Social Responsibility in relation to basic human and employee rights and also to testify to this. \n\n- Amfori BSCI ,  The Business Social Compliance Initiative (amfori BSCI) was established by amfori in 2003, with the aim of improving social performance in the increasingly complex global supply chains. The amfori BSCI Code of Conduct, which includes 11 fundamental principles, is based on the labor standards of the International Labour Organization, UN Charter of Human Rights and other key international and national regulations in the human rights sphere. \n\n- SEDEX The (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) is a web-based system designed to help organizations manage data on labour practices in their supply chain. Sedex was founded in 2004 by a group of British retailers, including Marks and Spencer, the John Lewis Partnership and Tesco. We are members of Sedex and share information with customers that use the platform as they require however we have our own portal that will make available to our customers who are not members of SEDEX where we share audit information.\n\n- SA 8000 is an internationally recognised standard which offers voluntary certification regarding observance of employee's rights. It includes the same requirements as Amfori BSCI, but augments these with a management system identical to standard DIN EN ISO 9001. These bodies, who's audits we recognise, all follow a very broadly aligned series of principles their 'base codes' that respectively follow the same principles as laid down by the International Labour organisation. \n\nTo give you a little more detail, I'm going to focus on one of the 3 programs we recognise and talk about the areas tested by a smeta audit. SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) assesses a site based on their organisation's standards of labour, health and safety, environment and business ethics.\n\n A SMETA audit helps us understand the working conditions at a manufacturing site. An auditor physically attends the site, to assess the conditions, working environment and interview staff. The resulting report enables us to monitor conditions for workers and focus in on any instances or indicators relating to zero tolerance human rights abuses, such as child or forced labour. \n\nOnce an assessment is complete, we work to address any issues, with the aid of a structured corrective action plan. \n\nThe audit is structured to cover the following base code areas: \n1. Employment is freely chosen \n2. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected \n3. Working conditions are safe and hygienic \n4. Child labour shall not be used \n5. Living wages are paid \n6. Hours are not excessive \n7. No discrimination is practiced \n8. Regular employment is provided \n9. No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed \n\nThese are the primary welfare and human rights areas we are assessing across our global supply chain, within our overseas social responsibility audit program\n###\n\nUSER: what are the topics can you help me with?\n\nMIAIH: I'm happy to help you with any questions regarding our business all the wider workwear and PPE industry I'm knowledgeable on all elements, subjects and best practise. the topics we've discussed so far are mere examples of my knowledge and ability to create policies and procedures and answer questions. so go for it Ask me anything and I will give you a full detailed answer that's always rooted in truth with examples where possible.\n###\n\n<existing response> <userinput>\n\nMIAIH: ",
